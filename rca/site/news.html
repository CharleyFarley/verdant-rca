		<p>This is the first new building to be constructed on the golden Mile, Blackpool for many years. it provides a focal point for visitors, and contains a very unusual mix of uses: a large restaurant and local information office at promenade level, with registry offices and ceremony hall for weddings above.
	Designed with dRMM, tower Festival Headland pursues de Rijkeâ€™s cross- laminated timber (CLt) research agenda, which promotes the adoption by the British construction industry, of high performance, low environmental impact structural timber, locally sourced. A greater use of this building material would help the uK achieve its eu Co2 reduction targets, while providing the strength and safety of conventionally constructed buildings.
	tower Festival is one of the first contemporary public buildings in the UK to be built entirely of timber, with a timber core and stairs. its experimental structure consists of a combined horizontal and a vertical cantilever, and is the third in a series of structural typology studies using CLt, the previous two being the shed and the frame, explored in the Kingsdale</p>
